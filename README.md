Project Description: In this project I am implementing a 1 bit full adder which is then utilized by my 4-bit full adder programs whom have 2 ways of implementing a full adder. The first is by ripple carry and the second is by carry look ahead.

Instructions:
For the 1 bit Full Adder you're going to want to write the code, create testbench and edit constraints file to add pproper pin assignments, Then you will synthesize, implement, generate bitstream and finally simulate. Once this works you can move on to creating your 4-bit full adders. You can start with either Ripple Carry or Carry Look Ahead. You must reference the 1-bit full adders in the 4-bit full adder code. Once you are done with the code then you follow the same steps as the 1 bit full adder. Make sure you are looking at area utilization for both ripple carry and carry look ahead
